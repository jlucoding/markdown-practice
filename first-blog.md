# Jonathan's Blog
One of today's lessons is to write a blog using Markdown. Instruction is asking students to share a little about my day, my favorite food, and favorite vacation destination.
## My day
I guess my day is ok. I wanted to sleep more but it's the second day of the bootcamp. So then I told myself to _WAKE UP_ and get ready to code. It's now towards the end of the class and so far so good other than the fact that I've been sleepy ever since I woke up.
## My favorite food
* Sushi
* Ramen
* Braised Pork with Rice
## My favorite vacation destinations
* My bed
